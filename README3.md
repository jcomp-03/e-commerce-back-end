  ## Installation
  After cloning or downloading a local copy of the repository, from a terminal install the required dependencies that are listed in the package.json file:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  Once the node_modules folder is created and all dependencies are downloaded, type the following in your terminal:
  ```
    npm start
    ```
    The `start` command effectively stands in for running *node index.js* as shown in the "scripts" property the package.json file you download.
